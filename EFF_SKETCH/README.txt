My implementation of the "etch-a-sketch" prompt from
theOdinProject.  I have some more complex ideas that 
i'd like to implementat once the basic functionality is 
there.  

Since I'm trying to tailor a few projects to the CustomInk
sensibility, I'd like to have a separate
window on the screen that translates the user's input
design onto a t-shirt blank.  I would then like to 
figure out how to convert the input pixel information to
a film ready output document.  That part will probably 
cause the most headaches, but since I've already basically
finished the toy project in terms of the OdinProject's expectations,
i'm just havin some fun with it.
